# Bike Share Project
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Term 1 Python Project

## Before Running
Please ensure that the city data CSV files are in the same directory as the bikeshare_2.py file.
This will ensure that the program is able to load the city data files and run smoothly.


## Interacting with the console
When running the program with the command, python3 bikeshare_2.py, the console will prompt you by
asking you which city you would like to pick. Choose any of the following:
- 'Chicago'
- 'New York city'
- 'Washington'

To pick a month choose from any of the following:
- 'January'
- 'February'
- 'March'
- 'April'
- 'May'
- 'June'
- 'all'

The 'all' command will use all months.

Finally, to select a day, pick any of the following:
- 'Sunday'
- 'Monday'
- 'Tuesday'
- 'Wednesday'
- 'Thursday'
- 'Friday'
- 'all'
Just like with months, the 'all' command will use all days.

The program does not expect any specific case, but it will ask you forever unless you send a
keyboard interrupt command (Ctrl + c).

### Exiting Data selection loop
You might want to quit from the program while selecting the city, month, and day. To do this
just send a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl + c). The program will ask you if you really want to
quit, just type "Y" or "y" and the program will exit immediately.
